# Starknet.id naming service

# What's a Starknet.id domain?

A starknet.id domain ends in ``.stark``. It is part of a Starkned.id and its owner can chose what is its target address.
For example, if I own the starknet.id having the domain ``th0rgal.stark``, I can decide that it should resolve to my own starknet account address.
